**Benita Roth**  
June 1, 1960 - May 27th, 2023  
<br />  

[Professor Benita Roth](https://www.binghamton.edu/sociology/faculty/benita-roth.html), a feminist intersectional scholar, union leader, and valued colleague, teacher and advisor, died on May 27th, 2023. She was 62.  

Benita Roth was Professor of Sociology and History, and Director of the transdisciplinary program in Women, Gender and Sexuality Studies at Binghamton University. From 2010-2015, she also served as the associate editor for the Journal of Women’s History.  

Building on feminist intersectional scholarship, Benita Roth’s research foregrounds the work of feminists and those who fought the ravages of AIDS and opioids, even as it unflinchingly captures the inequalities that fissured these movements. In recognition of the important contributions it made, her first book, Separate Roads to Feminism: Black Chicana, and White Feminist Movements in America's Second Wave (Cambridge U. Press, 2004), earned the distinguished book award in sex and gender from the American Sociological Association. According to the [awards committee](https://asasexandgender.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/october6.pdf), the book filled “a critical gap by…taking on the mainstream account that claims women of color came late to feminism.” Instead, as Roth’s work shows, “Black and Chicana feminism emerged at the same time as women's liberation” and that “by incorporating race and class, not just gender, in their analyses, these women-of-color groups anticipated the "intersectional" theorizing that has so influenced our field over the past 20 years.”  

The insights offered by Benita Roth’s research are not limited only to the academic.  They are also strategic, as her [comments](https://shorensteincenter.org/beyond-white-feminism-not-healing-the-us-back-to-an-anti-feminist-future-2/) on how to avoid “‘Healing’ the US back to an Anti-Feminist Future” (January 2021) reveal.  Her second book, The Life and Death of ACT UP/LA (Cambridge U. Press, 2017), tells a “largely lost” success story of “the accomplishments of direct-action anti-AIDS protest.” In keeping with her book’s assessment that gender inequalities undermined the group’s momentum, she [advises activists](https://pinkplaymags.com/2017/08/benita-roth-life-death-act-upla/) to “always be actively conscious of how they construct solidarity, who is included, whose voices are excluded, who gets listened to.” She underscored such strategic lessons when she [interviewed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtAVvJMLGGk) former ACT UP/NY activist, Ron Goldberg.  Her most recent research  [project](https://ssha2022.ssha.org/abstracts/220209) --focused on the fight against the opioid epidemic in Central New York by people involved with [Truth Pharm](https://truthpharm.org/) —similarly derived strategic implications for activists facing different local political and institutional contexts.  

Benita Roth’s commitment to equity extended beyond her scholarship to praxis. As described by her colleagues at the [UUP (United University Professions)](https://uupinfo.org/communications/uupdate/230531.php), she vigorously represented the interests of all professionals, including that of faculty, at Binghamton University through more than  fifteen years (2007-2023) of dedicated service: as the elected Chapter President between 2013-2017, and as Vice President for Academics for the Binghamton Chapter of the union since. Most recently, Benita was also a member of the state-wide contract negotiations team and a member of the state UUP Executive Board. As in the case of her early experience of research and activism with ACT UP/LA in the 1990s, her recent work with Truth Pharm also drew her into an immediate fight for justice. In recent years, Benita became a vocal advocate for harm reduction, conducting Narcan trainings in the community.  

In losing Benita, we also lose a dynamic instructor, loyal colleague and friend. A champion of sociology as a seed for social change and a committed advisor to the independent research of both undergraduates and graduate students, Professor Roth received the SUNY Chancellor’s Award for Excellence in Teaching in 2007.  She brought a steady hand and witty repartee to departmental deliberations in Sociology and WGSS, and an infectious confidence in all our endeavors. To many of us at the University and to many more beyond, she was also a trusted friend: one who might admonish self-doubt just as easily as regale with anecdotes of the absurd and the obscene from Hollywood to politics.

**Stanley L. Engerman**  
March 14, 1936 - May 11, 2023  
<br />

 [Stanley L. Engerman](https://brightonmc.com/obituaries/stanley-lewis-engerman/2632/), devoted husband, father, grandfather, and scholar, died peacefully in his sleep on May 11, 2023, at the age of 87.  He had been battling Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS) for much of 2023.  Together with his late wife Judith Rader Engerman (1940-2019), he raised three sons and kept a lively household with a stream of friends and colleagues visiting from near and far.  

They spent much of their lives in Rochester, New York, moving there in 1963 when he was hired as Assistant Professor of Economics at the University of Rochester.  He gravitated to the field of economic history, which he had first been exposed to while completing his doctorate at The Johns Hopkins University.  His most widely read work was Time on the Cross (1974), an economic analysis of American slavery, which he wrote together with Robert Fogel; that book won the Bancroft Prize in American History and is widely recognized for its significant contributions to the understanding of the pre-Civil War South.  In the 1990s, he and collaborator Ken Sokoloff published a series of influential articles that were collected in a volume, Economic Development in the Americas (2012).  Among his many professional honors were elections to the presidencies of the Economic History Association and the Social Science History Association, and appointment as the Pitt Professor in American History at the University of Cambridge.  He retired as the John H. Munro Professor of Economics and History at the University of Rochester in 2017.

Shortly after his retirement, Stan and Judy moved to the Boston area to be closer to their three sons and six grandchildren.  He is predeceased by Judy, who died in 2019; he is survived by his sister Natalie Mayrsohn and by sons David (and wife Stephanie Wratten, children Nina and Simon), Mark (and wife Jill Engerman, children Kaylin and Brandon), and Jeff (and children Maxwell and El, and partner Julia and her two daughters).

A memorial service will be held on Sunday May 21st at 11 am at Brighton Memorial Chapel, 3325 Winton Road South, Rochester New York.  In lieu of flowers, please consider donations in his memory to the Stanley L. Engerman Endowed Fund for Economics at the University of Rochester, or to the American Cancer Society.

**Augustus Leon (Lee) Beier IV**    
October 1, 1941 - February 25, 2023  
<br />

He had a big personality to match his tall frame. People remember his enthusiasm for conversation, rock ‘n roll, soccer, basketball (Go, Bulls!), and anything with a motor. Lee Beier, who died on February 25, 2023, after a long battle with Parkinson’s Disease and Lewy Body Dementia, lived his 81 years to the fullest.  

Born in Rice Lake, Wisconsin, on October 2, 1941, Lee grew up in Madison, Wisconsin, graduating from Monona Grove High School in 1959. His most important and formative experience as a youth was marching and playing the bass bugle with the Madison Scouts Drum and Bugle Corps. He kept in touch with fellow members of the Corps for the rest of his life, attending reunions, maintaining friendships, and taking his sons to performances and competitions.  

Lee attended the University of Wisconsin (Madison), where he majored in history and graduated in 1963. He then spent a Fulbright year in Nancy, France, where he firmed up his intention to become a professional historian. He completed his Ph.D. in history at Princeton University, beginning his life-long dedication to doing and teaching social history. He worked as a history professor, first at Lancaster University (UK), later at Illinois State University (Normal). He published many books, scholarly articles, and reviews, mainly focusing on 16th- and 17th-century British history.  

Although Lee spent much of his life far from the woods and waters of northwestern Wisconsin, the small lakes of the region were always his happy place. He grew up enjoying summers at Pine Lake, near New Auburn, and, as an adult, owned cabins on, first, Fireside Lake, then Round Lake, where he lived full-time after his retirement in 2009. An avid swimmer, he was always first in the chilly spring waters after the ice went out, and took his last dive off the dock in September.  

Lee Beier is survived by his children, Robert Joseph McCray Beier (Jen), Jesse Callaghan McCray Beier (Lisa), Jacob Leon McCray Beier, and Zachary James McCray Beier (Rachel). He is also survived by his ex-wife, Lucinda McCray, five grandchildren, and his sisters, Victoria, Ann, and Katherine. A celebration of his life is planned for early summer.
