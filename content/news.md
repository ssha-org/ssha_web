<h3><b>How will SSHA 2021 work?</b></h3>
<br />
<p><font size="4">Dear SSHA Community,</font></p>  

<p><font size="4">We are looking forward to seeing many of you, either in-person or virtually, at next week's SSHA Annual Meeting in Philadelphia!  The following email contains information about how our hybrid conference will work.</p>  

<p><font size="4"><b>COVID-19 Attestation</b><br />
Everyone attending SSHA 2021 in person will be required to attest to either being fully vaccinated against COVID-19 OR having had a negative COVID-19 test within 48 hours of the start of the conference. Conference attendees will be able to attest to their vaccination status prior to arrival, or on-site during conference check-in.  Please watch your email for information about advance, online COVID-19 attestation from Indiana University Conferences (IUC), but if you don’t complete this step prior to arrival be assured we will have attestation available at the conference registration booth.</font></p> 

<p><font size="4"><b>Mask up</b><br />
We will be requiring that everyone wear masks while inside of the hotel, whether it be the hallways or in session rooms.  Presenters, who may prefer or need to remove their masks while speaking, will be placed at least six feet away in session rooms. For receptions, you will be allowed, of course, to remove your mask to eat and drink.
</font></p> 

<p><font size="4"><b>Social Distancing</b><br />
We will be doing our best to accommodate social distancing in both seating and in the areas around the conference venue. Attendees are asked to keep social distancing in mind at all times, and to recognize that individuals have various degrees of comfort with levels of physical proximity and contact during normal times, and more so during a pandemic.  Let’s be respectful of differences and socially distance from each other, to help make the conference as good as it can be for every in-person attendee!</font></p>

<p><font size="4"><b>Sanitization Protocols</b><br />
The DoubleTree by Hilton Philadelphia Center City has increased their sanitization protocols in response to the pandemic to provide guests with a clean and safe environment to gather. We will also be having hand sanitizer stations placed throughout the space for easy access.</font></p>

<p><font size="4"><b>Logistics for In-person Attendees</b><br />
For in-person attendees, the SSHA 2021 conference will look very familiar and follow SSHA’s long-held Thursday-Sunday format. One difference, and this is important for everyone to note: all scheduled session times are 105 minutes (one hour 45 minutes) in length. This scheduling was required to make the logistics of the conference work within the various constraints we faced this year. The other main difference that in-person attendees will see is the presence of virtual attendees in each session room, network meeting, committee meeting, etc.</font></p>

<p><font size="4"><b>Logistics for Virtual Attendees</b><br />
For virtual attendees, each session room will equipped to be fully hybrid, so that everyone can participate, regardless of whether they are in-person or remote. Our goal is to make physical proximity as irrelevant as possible to joining, and participating in, an SSHA conference session. Indiana University Conferences will be using the virtual conference platform Whova to make all of this possible, and you can think of Whova as a shell or interface that wraps around Zoom. If you have used Zoom in the last 18 or so months, you’ll be able to use Whova. Whova can be accessed via the web or through a mobile app available for Apple and Android devices, so it will be useful to both in-person and remote attendees. And in order to access Whova at SSHA 2021, you must be registered for the SSHA conference, so IUC knows to give you access.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Using Whova, virtual attendees will be able to join any session they wish to livestream – no need to mess around with any zoom links. When entering a conference session, virtual attendees will see a camera feed of the in-person presenter(s). And—because this is Zoom embedded within Whova, remote attendee video and audio will be part of the virtual meeting and projected on screen and via speakers into the session room.* Microphones in the room will allow you to hear presenters speaking as well as any in-person audience member who asks questions into the Q&A microphone at the front of the room, and as long as remote participants have their camera and microphone turned on, we hope it will be almost as good as being present in person!</font></p>

<p><font size="4">*<i>If remote participants so choose. Generally it is recommended that remote participants join with their camera on and their microphone muted (unless speaking), unless circumstances or personal preference dictate otherwise.</i></font></p>
<br />
<p><font size="4"><b>Some Questions and Answers</b><br />
Q: Will you be recording SSHA conference sessions?<br />
A:  Yes, we plan on recording all sessions so that you won’t have to worry about missing out on any other concurrent paper session. All recordings will be available for 6 months following the conference.
<br /><br />
Q: When and how will I receive my Whova link?<br />
A:  Indiana University Conferences will be sending out Whova credentials via email on or about November 5th.  If you haven’t received your Whova details by November 7th, contact IU Conferences at iucvrtl@iu.edu.
<br /><br />
Q:  How long are SSHA 2021 sessions?<br />
A:  All sessions are 105 minutes in length, or one hour 45 minutes.
<br /><br />
Q:  Some or all of my session’s participants are going to be remote.  Do we need to alert anyone in advance?<br />
A:  No, because we are setting up each room with video and audio in both directions, a conference session can take place whether all, some, or none of the presenters are physically present (and the same goes for the audience, etc.).*</font></p>

<p><font size="4">*<i>At least that is the theory!  Please bear with us as we “go live” with this brave new approach to conferencing on November 11. Undoubtedly there will be some glitches, but we will have staff in place to work through them and hope to offer a great conference experience for all.</i></font></p>  

<p><font size="4">It is not too late to register for the conference. Please help spread the word. Thank you!</font></p>  

<br />

Sincerely,
<br /><br />
William Block<br />
SSHA Executive Director</font></p>

<h3><b>SSHA 2021 Registration and Program now available</b></h3>
<br />
<p><font size="4">Dear SSHA Community,</font></p> 
<br />
<p><font size="4">Thank you for your patience while we worked on plans for our upcoming hybrid conference! Links to conference registration, a PDF of the program, and hotel details have now been posted at <a href="https://ssha.org" target="_blank">https://ssha.org</a>.</font></p>  

<p><font size="4">Meanwhile, I'd like to highlight an exciting opportunity made possible by the hybrid nature of our 2021 conference environment:  SSHA is extending its long-standing (usually local) graduate student $10 "non-program participant rate" to graduate students everywhere to remotely join the conference and see what our Association is all about. Any student that is not already part of the program is eligible for this greatly reduced rate and will be able to join the conference from afar. Please pass this news along to interested graduate students.
</font></p> 

<p><font size="4">Finally, many thanks to our 2021 Program Committee Co-Chairs, Timothy Thurber, Steven Sprick Schuster, Sadia Saeed, and Ho-fung Hung, for their efforts putting the final touches on the engaging content for next month's meeting.</font></p> 

<p><font size="4">We look forward to seeing many of you next month, either in-person (vaccinated, masked) or remotely!</font></p> 

<br />

Sincerely,
<br /><br />
William Block<br />
SSHA Executive Director</font></p>

<h3><b>Conference update from SSHA Executive Director Bill Block</b></h3>
<br />
<p><font size="4">Dear SSHA Community,</font></p> 
<br />
<p><font size="4">I am writing with exciting news about SSHA's upcoming conference in Philadelphia!</font></p>  

<p><font size="4">The SSHA 2021 Program Committee Co-Chairs are hard at work finalizing the program schedule, and once they are done we will be sending out a link to conference registration in the next few days.</font></p> 

<p><font size="4">...and everyone wants to know what modalities we will be supporting! I'm pleased to confirm that SSHA 2021 will be providing Zoom-style connectivity in every conference session, in an attempt to facilitate the broadest possible access for all conference registrants, physically present or remote.</font></p> 

<p><font size="4">Based on the results of our two recent surveys, we do expect to see many of you in person. Please be assured we will be following the latest scientific advice regarding masks and social distancing during the conference, and we encourage everyone to be fully vaccinated.</font></p> 

<p><font size="4">Please watch your inboxes for the next SSHA communication that will contain information about the conference schedule and registration. Meanwhile, if you are really anxious to "take action" on something SSHA-related, you can always <a href="https://ssha.org/membership/" target="_blank">renew your annual membership</a>!</font></p>

<h3><b>Conference update from SSHA President Manali Desai</b></h3>

<br />
<p><font size="4">Dear SSHA Community,</font></p> 
<br />
<p><font size="4">I’d like to thank you for your patience during what has been an uncertain year with several recent developments on the pandemic front. The good news is that many of us are working behind the scenes to put together an exciting conference, and are planning for both virtual and in-person attendance options.</font></p>  

<p><font size="4">Despite many advances on the vaccine front the situation with COVID remains fluid, and the recent rise in circulation of the Delta variant has once again created new uncertainties. With this in mind we understand that while people may WANT to attend in person, we expect a certain number to attend virtually, with some making their decision at the last minute, and we hope to accommodate everyone as much as possible. We are also aware that our international members and participants will face additional challenges with travel to the United States.</font></p> 

<p><font size="4">IUC, our long-time conference organizer, has gained a lot of experience with virtual meetings in the last year, and we are confident that we can create an excellent conference experience that is simultaneously in-person and virtual. Please note that registration will open later than usual, as we work to sort out the meeting details.</font></p> 

<p><font size="4">To help IUC with planning and logistics, it would be helpful to know how many members are currently leaning toward in-person, virtual, or are unsure about their preferred method of conference attendance.  You can indicate your preference by filling out a <a href="https://ssha.us4.list-manage.com/track/click?u=2c2c3629b0ef59ce74f3208e1&id=e7e8e6229b&e=8333b789c4" target="_blank">simple, one question, no obligation poll:</a></font></p>

<p><font size="4">Again, thank you for your patience while he navigate these unchartered waters. We hope to update you again soon.
<br /><br />
Sincerely,

<h3><b>2020 SSHA Conference in Washington DC has been canceled</b></h3>
<br />
<p><font size="4">Dear SSHA Colleagues,</font></p>  
	
<p><font size="4">I’m writing with the unfortunate news that, based on the worsening COVID-19 environment in the United States, the SSHA Executive Committee has voted to cancel our 2020 annual conference. I want to thank the 2020 Program Committee Co-Chairs (Linda Reeder, Jonas Helgertz, Timothy Thurber, and Steven Sprick Schuster) and every SSHA Network Representative, for the hard work that went into preparing what was shaping up to be an excellent conference program. Your efforts are very much appreciated!</font></p>  
	
<p><font size="4">While I am sorry that we won’t be able to meet in person this fall, I want to especially note the Association’s regret to early career scholars and graduate students who were planning to present their work at the 2020 conference. We are already thinking ahead to 2021, and our plan is to make it easy to re-submit (or update) conference proposals from this year to next, to ease the process of participating in our 2021 annual meeting. Note that with annual SSHA conferences already scheduled in Philadelphia (2021) and Chicago (2022), we hope to reschedule our Washington location for our annual conference in 2023.</font></p>  

<p><font size="4">Please stay tuned for our plans for a virtual 2020 SSHA Presidential Address and Business Meeting. The work of the Association must go on and I look forward to interacting with many of you virtually in that setting! And if you haven’t yet renewed your <a href="https://indianauniv-web.ungerboeck.com/mbd/mbd_p23_add_member.aspx?oc=10&cc=SSHA-MEMBER" target="_blank">annual membership in SSHA</a>, now would be a good time.</font></p> 

<p><font size="4">Meanwhile, I hope each of you take steps to be well, and please accept my best wishes for the coming months.</font></p>

Sincerely,  

Phil Hoffman

<h3><b>SSHA Executive Committee Statement on Racism and History</b></h3>
<br />
<p><font size="4">Throughout the world, people have been outraged by George Floyd’s death at the hands of the police.  They have protested and demanded action, for his death was simply the latest chapter in a long and painful history of injustice, discrimination, and violent oppression visited upon African Americans.  Floyd’s death and the demonstrations that followed force us all to confront that history and to call for lasting change, change both in government policy and in our own behavior.</font></p>  
	
<p><font size="4">As officers and members of the executive committee of the Social Science History Association, we support the protestors who call for action and condemnation of acts of racism.  We urge all members to reflect on the harm that our history causes African Americans, from deaths at the hands of the police to higher pandemic mortality rates and systemic inequality that keeps children from realizing their potential.  And we ask members to consider too how their own silence may aggravate that harm.</font></p>  
	
<p><font size="4">Most of us will conclude that we have to do something.  Some may redirect their research toward analyzing the sad consequences of our history.  Others may choose to protest and to work for lasting reform.</font></p>  

<p><font size="4">Other academic organizations have issued statements about the tragic events in our country, their historical roots, and the need for change.  We endorse the spirit of their suggestions, which  may help us decide what course of action to take.  Here are examples from associations of anthropologists, economists, historians, political scientists, and sociologists:</font></p>
