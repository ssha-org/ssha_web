### Education, Knowledge, and Science

The Education/Knowledge/Science (EKS) Network, as one of many parts of the Social Science History Association, brings together scholars across disciplines to the social studies of science, formal education, and processes of knowledge production in broadly historical terms. Current areas of special interest among those within the network include: education and social stratification by race, class, and gender; the history of K-12 and higher education institutions and practices; theoretical bases of social-scientific research; theoretical and methodological engagement between Science & Technology Studies and disciplinary traditions in the social sciences; the politics of expertise; and historical-comparative analyses of science, knowledge, and culture. At each SSHA Annual Meeting, the EKS network sponsors its own sessions as well as collaborates with other networks (especially the Politics and Culture networks) to sponsor paper panels, roundtables, and book panel sessions.
