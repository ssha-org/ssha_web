### Crime, Justice, and the Law

The Crime, Justice and the Law Network is part of the Social Science History Association (SSHA) and linked with the European Social Science History Conference (ESSHC). The network brings together historians, sociologists, economists, criminologists, geographers, lawyers and independent scholars who are interested in both historical and contemporary developments in crime, policing and the law. The purpose is to provide an international forum for the exchange of ideas and research across disciplines and methodologies. Many members of the network attend the annual meetings of the SSHA and the ESSHC to participate in sessions, roundtables, and poster displays that include the presentation of papers and discussions on important books, ongoing research projects and new research methods. The network prides itself in having a global approach to research on criminality, judicial and legal systems and encourages comparative perspectives on these subjects.
