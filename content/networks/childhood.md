### Childhood and Youth

The Childhood & Youth Network of the Social Science History Association brings together scholars from a variety of disciplines who are interested in studying the experiences, ideas, and issues surrounding children, childhood, and youth cultures. 

Some possible topics of papers and panels for the annual meeting include:
-	Concepts and Methods in the History of Childhood and Youth
-	Children on the Move
-	Children and Health
-	Children as Political Agents 
-	Youth Activism
-	Ideologies of Childhood
-	Child Migrants and Refugees
-	Children in Times of Conflict
-	Childhood and the Environment
-	Child Policies in the US 
-	Children, Youth, and Political Movements
-	Archive Stories and Questions of Silence
-	The Politics of Schooling
-	Children as Political Subjects
-	Teaching Childhood and Youth
-	Toys, Play, and Material Culture

Papers and panels on any other aspects of the history of children, childhood, and youth are also certainly welcome.

The annual meeting provides a very supportive environment in which to present new work. We invite submissions of papers or (preferably) full panels which should include at least three papers and presenters from more than one academic institution and discipline. Other formats, including roundtable discussions and book sessions, are also possible. We especially welcome panels and papers that engage in transnational and interdisciplinary research. Graduate students presenting at the conference may apply for a travel grant from the SSHA.

Please contact the Childhood and Youth Network co-chairs if you have questions, comments, or are interested in submitting a paper or panel for the conference or serving as a chair or discussant.
