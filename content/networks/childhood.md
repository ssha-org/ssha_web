### Childhood and Youth

The Childhood & Youth Network of the Social Science History Association brings together scholars from a variety of disciplines who are interested in studying the experiences, ideas, and issues surrounding children, childhood, and youth cultures.  The network has recently organized panels on the following themes:

- Child Migrants and Refugees
- Childhood and Colonialism
- The Emotional Lives of Children
- Spaces of Childhood
- Documenting Histories of Childhood and Youth
- Schooling and Education
- Child Labor
- Children at War
- Children, Youth, and Political Movements
- Children and the Environment
- Youth and Commodification

We invite submissions of papers or (preferably) full panels by February.  We especially welcome panels and papers that engage in transnational and interdisciplinary research.   Please contact the Childhood and Youth network co-chairs if you have questions, comments, or are interested in submitting a paper or panel for the conference or serving as a chair or discussant.
