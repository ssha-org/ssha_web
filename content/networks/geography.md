### Historical Geography and GIS

The Historical Geography and GIS Network focuses on the application of spatial thinking to the study of the past, with a growing focus on GIS-based research. Our papers often take an interdisciplinary approach and incorporate topics such as demography, urban studies, environmental history, migration studies, and health, among others.
