### Women, Gender and Sexuality

**Who we are:**  
The Women, Gender, and Sexuality Network of the SSHA seeks to inspire interdisciplinary collaboration among scholars interested in the study of women, men, gender, and sexuality around the world. WGS network members are excited to increase the reach of our very active network through papers and panels – often collaborating with other SSHA networks. We work with scholars who focus on feminist, queer and intersectional approaches to the study of power, the body, identities, the law, policy, social movements, migration, spaces, language, intimacies, etc.; we have explored such themes as “sex in the sixties” from new perspectives and geographical variety – and are eager to further expand such areas as sex, gender, and human rights, transgender studies, transnational feminist activism, disability studies, and more.

**How to join us:**  
Shortly after each annual conference (always in November) we post a network-specific call for papers for the following year. We invite submissions of full panels (preferably), and are happy to consider individual paper submissions as well. We are always interested to hear from scholars who are willing to volunteer to be chairs or discussants. The SSHA website provides the opportunity to register your willingness to serve in such positions. Please submit panel and paper proposals at http://ssha2022.ssha.org/. You need to provide an abstract, title, and contact information. The submission process also requires that you mark the selections of your primary designated network (WGS). You may indicate one or more choices of possible fits in secondary networks.

For questions and further information about our network, please feel free to contact any of the network co-chairs (contacts listed below). For more information about the conference including the conference-wide call for papers, and the other networks, please see the SSHA website at http://www.ssha.org.
