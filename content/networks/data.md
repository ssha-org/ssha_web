### Data Infrastructure

The Data Infrastructure Network is interested in broadly addressing issues and themes related to creating datasets for social science history, large and small, and the infrastructure required to support them.  We intend to cast a wide net when discussing “data infrastructure,” and topics of interest may include: technology, data capture, sustainability, findability, interoperability, metadata, funding, methodology, collaboration, harmonization, data linkage, and builders of the data.  The Data Infrastructure Network is happy to co-sponsor relevant data-intensive sessions with other SSHA Networks, including Economics, Family History and Demography, and Historical Geography and GIS networks, and others.
