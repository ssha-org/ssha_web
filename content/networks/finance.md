### Public Finance

The Public Finance Network invites scholarship the social, political and historical sources and consequences of taxation and other forms of public finance or economic regulation. Sessions listed with the Public Finance Network are often cross-listed with other networks, including Economics and States and Society.

Members of the Public Finance Network come from a variety of academic disciplines, including law, economics, sociology, history, and political science. In keeping with the inherently multidisciplinary nature of the network, and with the traditions of the SSHA, we welcome interdisciplinary panels, and encourage submissions from a wide variety of disciplinary perspectives.  Attendance at the conference provides participants with an excellent opportunity to learn about the most recent advances in this relatively new field of study and to meet other scholars – from all over the world – interested in understanding the why taxes, and other forms of public finance, matter.
