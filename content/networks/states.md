The submission deadline for 2018 is March 1, 2018; submissions can be made via the following link: http://prd.sshaconference.org/. This year the States and Society network is also interested in works on the following topics (generated by the participants at our network meeting in 2016 and 2017!):
- Borders and immigration
- Legitimation crises
- Political violence
- Nation states and statistics
- Ethnic communities and the state
- Alternatives to neoliberalism
- Critical junctures/events
- WWI legacies
- 500 year anniversary of the Reformation

Finally, if you or someone you know has a topical book related to this conference’s theme and would like to organize an author meets critics panels that is welcome as well – please let us know since the allotment for these are more limited!
