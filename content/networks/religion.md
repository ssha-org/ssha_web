### Religion

The SSHA Religion Network is open to all historically oriented scholarship on religion and society. We welcome contributions from historians, sociologists, political scientists, anthropologists, geographers, religious studies scholars, gender and sexuality studies scholars, and those in related fields. Some of the themes typically addressed in network sessions include religion and politics; religion, race, and ethnicity; religion, gender, and sexuality; religion and law; religious nationalism; religion and violence; religion and social movements; religion and state formation; religion and immigration; global religions; conversion and missionary activity; historical patterns of secularization; and secularism.
