## **SSHA Annual Conference**

<hr width=300; align=left>

The 2021 conference will be held in Philadelphia on November 11-14, at the DoubleTree by Hilton Philadelphia Center City. This will mark the 47th annual meeting of the Social Science History Association. The conference theme this year is “Crisis, Conjunctures, Turning Points: Theory and Method in Turbulent Times.” Please refer to the [**SSHA Call for Papers**](/files/2021_SSHA_CFP.pdf) for information on submitting individual papers and/or panel proposals, submission deadlines, and Graduate Student Travel Grants.

### When, Where and Who 

We meet every fall, usually in November. The location changes according to the following logic: once every three years in Chicago, once every three years somewhere on the ‘East Coast’ and once every three years somewhere else. Since 2010, the Association has extended its reach to include Canadian cities as possible locations. The conference involves over a thousand scholars from around the world, although graduate students and faculty from the leading American universities predominate.

### Registration

SSHA requires that all session participants register for the annual meeting and be (or become) members of the SSHA.  If your membership is not current, you will not be able to register for the conference as a member.  Please sign up for membership, or renew your membership prior to filling out the conference registration form.

Membership is on a rolling basis – good for 12 months from the date of your joining/renewal—and includes a subscription to the Social Science History journal. If you have not yet signed up or renewed your membership, please do so before registering for the conference, in order to receive the discounted member registration fee. To sign up for an SSHA membership, please visit the <a href="https://indianauniv-web.ungerboeck.com/mbd/mbd_p23_add_member.aspx?oc=10&cc=SSHA-MEMBER" target="_blank">**SSHA membership registration website**</a>.

Registration fee includes admittance to all paper sessions, as well as Thursday and Saturday receptions. All session participants must register for the conference and be (or become) a member of SSHA. We ask that session participants register by TBA.

### Awards and Grants  

The Association promotes high quality scholarship through its awards program, which recognize the best work by a younger scholar and the best work by any scholar in our many fields. We also facilitate the participation of graduate students through a travel grant. Please note that students applying for these funds need to fill out the appropriate form and submit it along with their proposed to the network representatives. They will be informed of the result of that competition at the same time as they hear whether or not their paper has been accepted.
