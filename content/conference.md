### Hotel Information

**Important!!**

SSHA recognizes that you have a number of options when securing hotel accommodations for the annual meeting.  It is important to keep in mind that SSHA has made a major commitment to the DoubleTree by Hilton Philadelphia Center City in order to secure a large block of quality hotel rooms at competitive prices in a convenient location.  SSHA is legally bound to fill these rooms.  Not to do so has severe financial implications for SSHA, both in 2021 and in years to come and will almost certainly raise your costs of attending future annual meetings.  If you require a hotel in Philadelphia, we would appreciate it if you would reserve your room at the DoubleTree by Hilton Philadelphia Center City.

SSHA has a special group rate of $239 (single occupancy), $239 (double occupancy), $249 (triple occupancy) or $259 (quad occupancy) per night plus tax.  The hotel has set up a special reservation site for the Social Science History Association.  To access the site and make your reservation, <a href="https://book.passkey.com/go/SSHA" target="_blank">Click Here</a>.

If you would like to reserve your room before or after the event dates shown, please call the Hilton Reservations Department directly at 1-215-893-1600 (Phone Reservation Code: SSH).

We also facilitate the participation of graduate students through a travel grant. Please note that students applying for these funds need to fill out the appropriate form and submit it along with their proposed to the network representatives. They will be informed of the result of that competition at the same time as they hear whether or not their paper has been accepted.
