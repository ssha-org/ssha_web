### **ABOUT THE SSHA ANNUAL CONFERENCE**  

<h2><a href="http://ssha2023.ssha.org/" target="_blank" role="button" class="btn btn-default btn-lg"><i><h3>2023 Conference Submission Deadline Extended</h3></i></a></h2><br />

The SSHA conference meets annually, usually in November. The location changes according to the following logic: once every three years in Chicago, once every three years somewhere on the ‘East Coast’ and once every three years somewhere else. Since 2010, the Association has extended its reach to include Canadian cities as possible locations. The conference involves over a thousand scholars from around the world, although graduate students and faculty from the leading American universities predominate.  
<br />  

### **THE 2023 ANNUAL CONFERENCE**

<i>Hotel Information & Reservations</i>  

SSHA recognizes that you have a number of options when securing hotel accommodations for the annual meeting.  It is important to keep in mind that SSHA has made a major commitment to the conference hotel in order to secure a large block of quality hotel rooms at competitive prices in a convenient location.  SSHA is legally bound to fill these rooms.  Not doing so has severe financial implications for SSHA, both in the current year and in years to come, and will almost certainly raise your costs of attending future annual meetings.  
 
<br />
<i>Awards and Grants</i>  

The Association promotes high quality scholarship through its awards program, which recognize the best work by a younger scholar and the best work by any scholar in our many fields. We also facilitate the participation of graduate students through a travel grant. Please note that students applying for these funds need to fill out the appropriate form and submit it along with their proposed to the network representatives. They will be informed of the result of that competition at the same time as they hear whether or not their paper has been accepted.  
<br />
<i>Richard Sutch Student Travel Awards</i>  

The _Richard Sutch Student Travel Awards_ application will be available for the 2023 SSHA annual conference in June of 2023.
