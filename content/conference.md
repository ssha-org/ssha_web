### **ABOUT THE SSHA ANNUAL CONFERENCE**  

The SSHA conference meets annually, usually in November. The location changes according to the following logic: once every three years in Chicago, once every three years somewhere on the ‘East Coast’ and once every three years somewhere else. Since 2010, the Association has extended its reach to include Canadian cities as possible locations. The conference involves over a thousand scholars from around the world, although graduate students and faculty from the leading American universities predominate.  
<br />  

### **THE 2024 ANNUAL CONFERENCE**  

Our 2024 conference will be held in Toronto, ON, Canada from October 31 - November 3, 2024.  This year’s theme is <i>“Trust and Distrust of Historical Sources in the Digital Age.”</i> The preliminary conference program is [**now available**](https://ssha.org/files/SSHA2024_PreliminaryProgram.pdf).

<i>Hotel Information & Reservations</i>  

SSHA 2024 will be held at the Westin Harbour Castle on Toronto’s harbourfront, steps away from the ferries to Toronto Island and downtown Toronto, and close to the Art Gallery of Ontario, the CN Tower, the Distillery District and plenty of running and biking paths. [Click here to make a reservation at the Westin Harbour Castle](https://book.passkey.com/go/SSHA2024)

SSHA recognizes that you have a number of options when securing hotel accommodations for the annual meeting.  It is important to keep in mind that SSHA has made a major commitment to the conference hotel in order to secure a large block of quality hotel rooms at competitive prices in a convenient location.  SSHA is legally bound to fill these rooms.  Not doing so has severe financial implications for SSHA, both in the current year and in years to come, and will almost certainly raise your costs of attending future annual meetings.  
<br />

<i>Awards and Grants</i>  

The Association promotes high quality scholarship through its awards program, which recognizes the best work by a younger scholar and the best work by any scholar in our many fields. We also facilitate the participation of graduate students through a travel grant. Please note that students applying for these funds need to fill out the appropriate form and submit it along with their proposed to the network representatives. They will be informed of the result of that competition at the same time as they hear whether or not their paper has been accepted.  
<br />  

<i>Richard Sutch Student Travel Awards</i>  

The Social Science History Association is pleased to offer a limited number of student travel grants to help offset the cost to graduate students (and the occasional exceptional undergraduate) attending our annual conference.  

To apply, please complete this application form available [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfJYALkvVBvrfxu_KSptBxU2fzxeEZlyhgfe-1qNFrawloBhQ/viewform?_requested=true&fbzx=-8195368214589861263).  The deadline for applying is Monday August 12, 2024. Notification of travel awards will be emailed to award recipients in mid to late August.
