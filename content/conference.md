### **ABOUT THE SSHA ANNUAL CONFERENCE**  

The SSHA conference meets annually, usually in November. The location changes according to the following logic: once every three years in Chicago, once every three years somewhere on the ‘East Coast’ and once every three years somewhere else. Since 2010, the Association has extended its reach to include Canadian cities as possible locations. The conference involves over a thousand scholars from around the world, although graduate students and faculty from the leading American universities predominate.  
<br />  

**Registration**  

SSHA requires that all session participants register for the annual meeting and be (or become) members of the SSHA.  If your membership is not current, you will not be able to register for the conference as a member.

Registration fees include admittance to all paper sessions, as well as Thursday and Saturday receptions. All session participants must register for the conference and be (or become) a member of SSHA.

<i>Hotel Information & Reservations</i>  

SSHA recognizes that you have a number of options when securing hotel accommodations for the annual meeting.  It is important to keep in mind that SSHA has made a major commitment to the conference hotel in order to secure a large block of quality hotel rooms at competitive prices in a convenient location.  SSHA is legally bound to fill these rooms.  Not doing so has severe financial implications for SSHA, both in the current year and in years to come, and will almost certainly raise your costs of attending future annual meetings.
