## **SSHA Annual Conference**

<hr width=300; align=left>  

### 2022 Conference

Our 2022 conference will be held in Chicago on November 17-20, 2022. We meet every fall, usually in November. The location changes according to the following logic: once every three years in Chicago, once every three years somewhere on the ‘East Coast’ and once every three years somewhere else. Since 2010, the Association has extended its reach to include Canadian cities as possible locations. The conference involves over a thousand scholars from around the world, although graduate students and faculty from the leading American universities predominate.  

### Registration

SSHA requires that all session participants register for the annual meeting and be (or become) members of the SSHA.  If your membership is not current, you will not be able to register for the conference as a member.  Please sign up for membership, or renew your membership prior to filling out the conference registration form.

Membership is on a rolling basis—good for 12 months from the date of your joining/renewal—and includes a subscription to the Social Science History journal. If you have not yet signed up or renewed your membership, please do so before registering for the conference, in order to receive the discounted member registration fee. To sign up for an SSHA membership, please visit the <a href="https://indianauniv-web.ungerboeck.com/mbd/mbd_p23_add_member.aspx?oc=10&cc=SSHA-MEMBER" target="_blank">SSHA membership registration website</a>.

Registration fee includes admittance to all paper sessions, as well as Thursday and Saturday receptions. All session participants must register for the conference and be (or become) a member of SSHA.

### Hotel Information

**Important!!**

SSHA recognizes that you have a number of options when securing hotel accommodations for the annual meeting.  It is important to keep in mind that SSHA has made a major commitment to the Palmer House Hilton in order to secure a large block of quality hotel rooms at competitive prices in a convenient location.  SSHA is legally bound to fill these rooms.  Not to do so has severe financial implications for SSHA, both in 2022 and in years to come and will almost certainly raise your costs of attending future annual meetings.  If you require a hotel in Chicago, we would very much appreciate it if you would reserve your room at the Palmer House Hilton.  

**Reservations**  

SSHA has a special group rate of $189  for both single and double occupancy per night plus tax.  The hotel has set up a special reservation site for the Social Science History Association. **To access the hotel reservation site and make your reservation, please click this link:** <a href="https://book.passkey.com/go/SocialScienceHistory" target="_blank">Hilton Reservations</a>.

If you would like to reserve your room before or after the event dates shown, please call the Hilton Reservations Department directly at 1-800-445-8667 and reference group code SSH.  Group rates cannot be guaranteed after October 15, 2022.

### Awards and Grants  

The Association promotes high quality scholarship through its awards program, which recognize the best work by a younger scholar and the best work by any scholar in our many fields. We also facilitate the participation of graduate students through a travel grant. Please note that students applying for these funds need to fill out the appropriate form and submit it along with their proposed to the network representatives. They will be informed of the result of that competition at the same time as they hear whether or not their paper has been accepted.
