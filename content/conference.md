### Registration

SSHA requires that all session participants register for the annual meeting and be (or become) members of the SSHA.  If your membership is not current, you will not be able to register for the conference as a member.  Please sign up for membership, or renew your membership prior to filling out the conference registration form.

Membership is on a rolling basis—good for 12 months from the date of your joining/renewal—and includes a subscription to the Social Science History journal. If you have not yet signed up or renewed your membership, please do so before registering for the conference, in order to receive the discounted member registration fee.

### Hotel Information

**Important!!**

SSHA recognizes that you have a number of options when securing hotel accommodations for the annual meeting.  It is important to keep in mind that SSHA has made a major commitment to the Palmer House Hilton in order to secure a large block of quality hotel rooms at competitive prices in a convenient location.  SSHA is legally bound to fill these rooms.  Not to do so has severe financial implications for SSHA, both in 2022 and in years to come and will almost certainly raise your costs of attending future annual meetings.  If you require a hotel in Philadelphia, we would very much appreciate it if you would reserve your room at the Palmer House Hilton.

### Awards and Grants  

The Association promotes high quality scholarship through its awards program, which recognize the best work by a younger scholar and the best work by any scholar in our many fields. We also facilitate the participation of graduate students through a travel grant. Please note that students applying for these funds need to fill out the appropriate form and submit it along with their proposed to the network representatives. They will be informed of the result of that competition at the same time as they hear whether or not their paper has been accepted.  

**Richard Sutch Student Travel Awards**  

The _Richard Sutch Student Travel Awards_ application will be available for the 2022 SSHA annual conference in the spring of 2022. The deadline for applying is **TBD**.
