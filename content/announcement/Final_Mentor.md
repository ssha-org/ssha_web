### **SSHA Pilot Mentoring Program**  

If you are like us, you are eagerly looking forward to the upcoming Social Science History Association annual meeting from Nov 16th to 19th in Washington, DC!  This year, to help newcomers and junior scholars feel welcome at the meeting, we are offering a pilot mentoring scheme.  
<br />  

<b>This is a volunteer program, so we need mentors!</b>  Prospective mentors and mentees should fill out 
this [Mentoring Program Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfCYLehhtTjfY65xJciq7nOs7YnarH-Z7mAuBQ1E8McX8rF4Q/viewform), and about a week before the conference, we will pair you with someone sharing your intellectual interests (pending availability).  
<br />

Any queries can be directed to Nicholas Wilson (nicholas.wilson@stonybrook.edu), the volunteer administrator of the program.
