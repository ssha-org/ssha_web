## **Social Science History**

<hr width=300; align=left> 

*Social Science History* is dedicated to the study of social theory within an empirical historical context. Our interdisciplinary readership includes anthropologists, demographers, economists, geographers, historians, political scientists, and sociologists, all in pursuit of a deep understanding of societies, past and present. The journal invites articles that blend empirical research with theoretical work, undertake comparisons across time and space, or contribute to the development of quantitative and qualitative methods of analysis. As the official journal of the Social Science History Association, *Social Science History* reflects the interests of members who are active in the Association’s diverse range of research networks. However, it also welcomes submissions from the broader international research community of historically informed social scientists.

*Social Science History* is published by [**Cambridge University Press**](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/social-science-history). The contact email for the editorial office is <socialsciencehistory@mit.edu>. Information about the Editors and Editorial Board can be found here: [**SSH Editors and Editorial Board**](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/social-science-history/information/editorial-board).

### Statement on Peer Review  

Social Science History seeks two or more subject and/or methodology experts for every paper entering peer review. We attempt to render a decision on each submission as quickly as possible. Current median time is 15 weeks. Because the range of expertise on which we depend is broad, and the availability of qualified reviewers varies, the review process sometimes extends longer.  

The emphasis in the mission of the journal is to provide a home for projects and publications that reach beyond the historical case study to address topics of larger importance to an interdisciplinary group. In judging, for example, whether an empirical article is of theoretical import, it is not sufficient that the analysis is embedded within theory but the results must have importance for expanding and developing upon past theoretical arguments. Similarly, historical studies are most aligned with the mission of the journal when they are explicitly comparative and the comparative research design has some salient features which speak to our general understanding of socio-historical phenomena.
