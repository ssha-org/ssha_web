## Calls for papers

**Call for Papers for the 50th Anniversary Issue of *Social Science History***

What is the relationship between the past and the present? What is the nature of how change occurs or does not occur over time? This anniversary issue explores the multiple possibilities. For example, in some cases, the present is seen in the past, as a repetition of it. This can be conceptualized as cycles of history that reoccur over time. However, another conceptualization is the past as a creator of the present—that is, the past in different ways leads to the present. These paths might be linear, path dependent, or historically constructed. Yet another idea is that past and present are unique, and in fact, unrelated.

Thus, the relationship between the past and present takes many different forms. Scholars who emphasize the repercussions of a new and unexpected shock imply discontinuity and rupture between past and present. In contrast, the literatures that document the later life consequences of early life or intergenerational experience tend to focus attention on continuities and the past as a creator of the present. Similarly, the long-term persistence of the structures of inequality suggests a process of replication and even stasis. Even social scientists who use statistical models to analyze historical data over time implies some kind of relationship between the past and later points. Variety exists within fields: both technology history and historical institutionalism offer up examples of developments that are path dependent along with ones that represent a complete break from the past. Whatever the field, the model, the literature and most importantly, the historical question, how the relationship between the past and present is perceived, is key to social science history research. These are just a few of the many possibilities!

The Fall 2026 issue is the 50th anniversary of Social Science History. For this issue, the theme of “past and present” will be explored. Papers should address this theme in some way, either theoretically, empirically, substantively (or some combination of them). All papers must be suitable for publication in [Social Science History](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/social-science-history) and will undergo peer review before publication.

200-word abstracts are due by April 2nd, 2024, and a final paper must be ready for review by January 15, 2025. Abstracts should be sent to [socialsciencehistory@ssha.org](mailto:socialsciencehistory@ssha.org).

**Advances in Data and Methods**

In the past decade, there has been an explosion of methods to analyze social science data, as well as increase in the raw data available to do so! Even what counts as data has been revolutionized. We announce a new series, **“Advances in Data and Methods”** in *Social Science History* to keep researchers up to date on these developments. We invite research articles and review essays for this new series that propose, develop or explain new or recently articulated sources and/or methodological techniques for use in social science history. Methods and data can be qualitative or quantitative. In all cases, we envision papers that push open new avenues, in terms of methods and data, to advance research. We invite review essays as well as substantive papers that apply these advances in data and methods. These papers will be published in the journal as they arrive, but they will also be linked in a virtual issue so that they form a series that can be a continuing resource for scholars.  

All papers based on accepted proposals undergo editorial review and, if suitable, peer review. All manuscripts must conform to [SSH style guidelines](https://ssha.org/files/SSHStyleGuide.pdf). They are all eligible to win the journal prizes: the annual Founder’s Prize, given by Cambridge University Press, and the Biannual Graduate Student Prize. *Social Science History* has a wide readership, as it goes to all members of the Social Science History Association. To submit a proposal, please send email to socialsciencehistory@ssha.org with a one-page abstract, a title, your contact information, and a proposed timeline.

## The Journal  
*Social Science History* is dedicated to the study of social theory within an empirical historical context. Our interdisciplinary readership includes anthropologists, demographers, economists, geographers, historians, political scientists, and sociologists, all in pursuit of a deep understanding of societies, past and present. The journal invites articles that blend empirical research with theoretical work, undertake comparisons across time and space, or contribute to the development of quantitative and qualitative methods of analysis. As the official journal of the Social Science History Association, *Social Science History* reflects the interests of members who are active in the Association’s diverse range of research networks. However, it also welcomes submissions from the broader international research community of historically informed social scientists.  

*Social Science History* is published by [**Cambridge University Press**](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/social-science-history). The contact email for the editorial office is [socialsciencehistory@ssha.org](mailto:socialsciencehistory@ssha.org). Information about the Editors and Editorial Board is [**here**](/editors_board/).

### Article types  

*Social Science History* publishes the following article types:  

1.	Research Articles  
2.	Presidential Addresses  
3.	Book Symposia  
4.	Special Section Articles  
5.	Special Issue Articles  
6.	Review Essays  

The above article types may be eligible for APC waivers or discounts under one of Cambridge University Press's [Open Access publishing agreements](https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/open-access-policies/waivers-discounts).  

Although research articles comprise the great majority of content for *Social Science History* we also publish book symposia, review articles and clusters of thematically-linked articles in a special issue or special section of an issue. Guidelines for these kinds of content are below.

**Guidelines for Book Symposia Proposals**  

Every year the Association’s conference includes a number of ‘author meets critic’ sessions intended for critical discussion of a recent monograph. Occasionally, a book-related symposium is of particular interest for publication in the journal. Accordingly, we invite proposals for the publication of book symposia in *SSH*. The kind of book symposium of interest for publication is one that provides clear intellectual debate and engagement, even criticism, rather than extended praise of the book. Proposals should include:

1. symposium title and date of SSHA conference panel for the book; 
2. names, affiliations, and contact information for all panelists, book authors, and panel organizers; 
3. book title, publication date, all other bibliographical information, and a summary of the book’s contribution highlighting cross-disciplinary appeal (no longer than 500 words); 
4. an indication that all panelists and authors have agreed to submit the proposal to <i>SSH</i>; 
5. a timeline for submission. Final submissions should be no longer than 9,000 words, with each contribution typically 1000 to 1500 words. Proposals should be submitted to <socialsciencehistory@ssha.org> by December 31 following the SSH meetings in November.  

**Guidelines for Special Issues and Sections**  

*SSH* has a long history of publishing thematic clusters of articles in a special issue or a special section of an issue. The ‘special issue’ consists of 7 to 9 papers; the ‘special section’ consists of 3 to 6 papers. We welcome proposals configured around any theme or topic that may interest members of the Association. Proposals should include: 

1. names, affiliations, and contact information for all authors and editors; 
2. titles and abstracts for all papers; 
3. summary of the special issue or section topic and the contribution of each paper; 
4. summary of the broader cross-disciplinary appeal (no longer than 500 words); 
5. a timeline for submission for peer review. Proposals should be submitted to <socialsciencehistory@ssha.org> by December 31 of each calendar year.

**Guidelines for Review Essays**  
    
We invite review essays on any topic pertinent to the cross-disciplinary mission of <i>SSH</i>. The essay might review methodological techniques, data analytics or sources, or topical areas across multiple disciplines of interest to our membership. It should be broad and intended to bring readers up to date on intellectual matters of current interest. Proposals for review essays may be submitted to the editors at any time. They should include: 

1. names, affiliations, and contact information for all authors; 
2. summary of the review essay; 
3. summary of its broader cross-disciplinary appeal;
4. a timeline for submission for peer review.  

**PLEASE NOTE**: All papers based on accepted proposals undergo editorial review and, if suitable, peer review. All manuscripts must conform to [SSH style guidelines](https://ssha.org/files/SSHStyleGuide.pdf).  

### Statement on Peer Review  

Social Science History seeks two or more subject and/or methodology experts for every paper entering peer review. We attempt to render a decision on each submission as quickly as possible. Current median time is 15 weeks. Because the range of expertise on which we depend is broad, and the availability of qualified reviewers varies, the review process sometimes extends longer.  

The emphasis in the mission of the journal is to provide a home for projects and publications that reach beyond the historical case study to address topics of larger importance to an interdisciplinary group. In judging, for example, whether an empirical article is of theoretical import, it is not sufficient that the analysis is embedded within theory but the results must have importance for expanding and developing upon past theoretical arguments. Similarly, historical studies are most aligned with the mission of the journal when they are explicitly comparative and the comparative research design has some salient features which speak to our general understanding of socio-historical phenomena.  

### Statement on Competing Interests  

The editors of Social Science History are committed to transparency with respect to competing interests as they pertain to editors, authors and peer reviewers. Social Science History publishes the journal in accordance with Cambridge University Press’s publishing ethics guidelines and supports the principles of ethical publishing as put forth by the Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE). These guidelines apply to authors, peer reviewers, the editorial office and the journal as a whole.

Authors are required to declare any potential competing interests to the editorial office at the time of initial submission. Reviewers who may have competing interests are asked to disclose those concerns to the editorial office prior to completing article reviews.

All concerns regarding editorial decisions should be addressed to the SSH journal office. Complaints and appeals will be adjudicated by SSH editors and/or SSH editorial board members in consultation with Cambridge University Press.
