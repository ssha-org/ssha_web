## **Social Science History**

<hr width=300; align=left> 

*Social Science History* is dedicated to the study of social theory within an empirical historical context. Our interdisciplinary readership includes anthropologists, demographers, economists, geographers, historians, political scientists, and sociologists, all in pursuit of a deep understanding of societies, past and present. The journal invites articles that blend empirical research with theoretical work, undertake comparisons across time and space, or contribute to the development of quantitative and qualitative methods of analysis. As the official journal of the Social Science History Association, *Social Science History* reflects the interests of members who are active in the Association’s diverse range of research networks. However, it also welcomes submissions from the broader international research community of historically informed social scientists.

*Social Science History* is published by [**Cambridge University Press**](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/social-science-history). The contact email for the editorial office is <socialsciencehistory@mit.edu>. Information about the Editors and Editorial Board can be found here: [**SSH Editors and Editorial Board**](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/social-science-history/information/editorial-board).

### Submission Information

*Social Science History* takes submissions via the online platform supported by Editorial Manager. To submit an article, please visit the [**SSH Editorial Manager**](https://www.editorialmanager.com/ssha/default.aspx) website. If this is your first time using Editorial Manager, you will need to register. Then follow the instructions on the site. Articles should be typed double-spaced, including quotations, notes, information in tables, and the list of references. Brief parenthetical citations are included in the text, all complete references are listed alphabetically at the end of the article, and notes are used only for discursive comments and appear immediately before the list of references. For detailed information on this journal’s style, contributors should refer to the [**SSH style guide**](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/social-science-history/information/instructions-contributors); a PDF copy of our style guide can be found here: [SSHStyleGuide.pdf](https://ssha.org/files/SSHStyleGuide.pdf). The Social Science History Association does not accept responsibility for statements of fact or opinion made by the contributors.  

### Statement on Peer Review  

Social Science History seeks two or more subject and/or methodology experts for every paper entering peer review. We attempt to render a decision on each submission as quickly as possible. Current median time is 15 weeks. Because the range of expertise on which we depend is broad, and the availability of qualified reviewers varies, the review process sometimes extends longer.  

The emphasis in the mission of the journal is to provide a home for projects and publications that reach beyond the historical case study to address topics of larger importance to an interdisciplinary group. In judging, for example, whether an empirical article is of theoretical import, it is not sufficient that the analysis is embedded within theory but the results must have importance for expanding and developing upon past theoretical arguments. Similarly, historical studies are most aligned with the mission of the journal when they are explicitly comparative and the comparative research design has some salient features which speak to our general understanding of socio-historical phenomena.  

### Statement on Competing Interests  

The editors of Social Science History are committed to transparency with respect to competing interests as they pertain to editors, authors and peer reviewers. Social Science History publishes the journal in accordance with Cambridge University Press’s publishing ethics guidelines and supports the principles of ethical publishing as put forth by the Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE). These guidelines apply to authors, peer reviewers, the editorial office and the journal as a whole.

Authors are required to declare any potential competing interests to the editorial office at the time of initial submission. Reviewers who may have competing interests are asked to disclose those concerns to the editorial office prior to completing article reviews.

All concerns regarding editorial decisions should be addressed to the SSH journal office. Complaints and appeals will be adjudicated by SSH editors and/or SSH editorial board members in consultation with Cambridge University Press.
