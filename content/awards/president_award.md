## Presidents Book Award  

A $1000 prize is awarded annually for a meritorious first work by an early-career scholar. Entrants are judged on scholarly significance, interdisciplinary reach, and methodological innovativeness within monographs analyzing past structures and events and change over time. Books with a copyright date of the previous year that are published within eight years of the author's Ph.D. are eligible for consideration.

**Please note:** the 2023 award committees are still being formed. Please check back periodically for updates.
