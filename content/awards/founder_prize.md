## Founder's Prize  

A $1,000 prize to be awarded annually for the best article published in the preceding volume year of the Association’s official journal, *Social Science History*.  The selection is made by a vote of the Editorial Board, in a two-stage process.  Nominations are solicited from the full membership of the board by June 30th of the year following a volume’s publication.  Nominations include a brief explanation of what is particularly extraordinary of the nominated article.  A sub-committee of the board consisting of 3 members, the Co-Editors and the Managing Editor, review the top nominated articles with the expectation that they will select a winner by early September.  The winner will be notified by mid-September with the hope that they can plan to attend the meeting in November where they will receive a check and a plaque.
