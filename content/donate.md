### *Our fundraising campaign*

SSHA recently named the Student Travel Awards in honor of Richard Sutch, distinguished social and economic historian, and long time member of SSHA. Richard passed away recently after a battle with Merkel cell carcinoma; you may read about his life and accomplishments at <a href="https://delong.typepad.com/files/sutch-obituary.pdf">https://delong.typepad.com/files/sutch-obituary.pdf</a>. All donations received through the end of the year will be devoted to endowing travel awards in Richardâ€™s name.
